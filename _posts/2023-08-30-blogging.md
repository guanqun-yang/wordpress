## Guidelines

<!-- To make sure the rendering is correct, it is helpful to use a Markdown linter available as a plugin in VSCode. For example, the `markdownlint` by David Anson (it has more than 5 million installs). -->

The newline between a list of bullets and a standalone paragraph like the current one is **necessary**:

    - Test level 2.
        - Test level 3.
            - Test level 4.
- There does not have to be a newline before and after a formula.
 $$
 a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 $$
