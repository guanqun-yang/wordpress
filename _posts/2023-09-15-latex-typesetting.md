# Overview

The computer science conferences have high tolerance for style variability, which leads to stark variances in the typesetting quality even for the final camera-ready version. Here is one such example: the left from [1] is much better than [2], which is a random sample from the same conference in the same year. As the latter is the impression of almost all of the papers from that conference, the paper [1] will easily stand out.

# Graphics
