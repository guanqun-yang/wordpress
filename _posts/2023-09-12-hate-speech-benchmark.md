It is possible to approximate a subset of the original training mixture (8 of 12 datasets excluding the MMHS dataset, which only includes hate speech) following the Table 2 of the original paper. Something to note is that:

- AYR, HASOC, HSHP, and LSC are not usable.
- Offense does not exactly match the sizes in Table 2.
- We **disregard** any splits and try to match the number in Table 2. When matching number is not possible, we try to make sure the ratio of `on-hate` versus `hate` is same.
