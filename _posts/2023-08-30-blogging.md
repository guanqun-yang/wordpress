## Overview

There are two ways of publishing blogs onto a personal WordPress site:

- Manual Copy and Paste
- Automatic Publishing based on the solution introduced in [GitHub](https://github.com/zhaoolee/WordPressXMLRPCTools) (written in Chinese).

## Guidelines

It is *better* to have a newline before and after a section title.

There **has to** be a newline before and after a list of bullets.

- Always use **4 spaces** rather than a `tab` when creating a lower level bullet point.
    - Test level 2.
        - Test level 3.
            - Test level 4.
- There **does not have to** be a newline before and after a formula.
 $$
 a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 $$
- If the contents in a bullet point has multiple paragraphs. Then it has to be organized as follows.
  
    There has to be **4 spaces** before the subordinate paragraphs. For example, this paragraph is the second paragraph.

    This is the third paragraph of the bullet.

Here we come back to the normal paragraphs.
