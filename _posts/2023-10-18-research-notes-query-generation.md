3. [What Are You Token About? Dense Retrieval as Distributions Over the Vocabulary](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.140) (Ram et al., ACL 2023): This paper proposes a method to project embeddings onto the vocabulary and obtains a distribution over the tokens. The motivation for this paper is interpretability.
