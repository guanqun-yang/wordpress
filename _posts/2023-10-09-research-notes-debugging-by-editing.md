# Additional Notes

-   The RDF triplet may be the most unambiguous way to express instances of a specification; it is a classical way to represent knowledge and could be bidirectionally converted from and to a SQL database ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple)).

# Reference

[Kevin Meng](https://mengk.me/) and [David Bau](https://baulab.info/) have published a series of works on knowledge editing for transformers:

1.   [[2210.07229] Mass-Editing Memory in a Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07229) (MEMIT system).
2.   [[2202.05262] Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262) (ROME system).

The following are other predecessors to the proposed approach:

3.   [[2012.00363] Modifying Memories in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00363): This paper first proposed the problem of fact editing for transformers.
