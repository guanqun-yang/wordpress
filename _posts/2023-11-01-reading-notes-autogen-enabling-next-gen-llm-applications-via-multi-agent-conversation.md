# Overview

# Qingyun Wu's Talk

-   The interaction between the users and the AutoGen system is **critical** for the system to be useful; fully autonomous systems are not trustworthy. For example, if the system does not deliver the outcome the user want, we could **not** know which step goes wrong.
-   In order for the system to be useful, the base models are important. We cannot use a very weak LM as one of the AI agents.
-   There are currently (as of 2023-11-01) no safety measures to make sure the system do not generate undesirable content.
