## Overview

There are two ways of publishing blogs onto a personal WordPress site:

- Manual Copy and Paste
- Automatic Publishing based on the solution introduced in [GitHub](https://github.com/zhaoolee/WordPressXMLRPCTools) (written in Chinese).

## Guidelines

To make sure the rendering is correct, it is helpful to use a Markdown linter available as a plugin in VSCode. For example, the `markdownlint` by David Anson (it has more than 5 million installs).

The newline between a list of bullets and a standalone paragraph like the current one is **necessary**:

- Always use a tab when creating a lower level bullet point for the reason explained in this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70791200/7784797).
  - Test level 2.
    - Test level 3.
      - Test level 4.
- Make sure there is a newline before and after a formula:

 $$
 a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 $$
