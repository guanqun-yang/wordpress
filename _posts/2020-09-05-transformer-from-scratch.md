# Overview

This post aims to implements the the transformer model and its variant from scratch. It is based on the following posts:

1.   [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/) (Harvard NLP)
2.   [The Illustrated Transformer – Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
3.   [GitHub - karpathy/minGPT: A minimal PyTorch re-implementation of the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) training](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT): Anderj Karpathy also creates a 2-hour [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) describing the process he creates the model.
